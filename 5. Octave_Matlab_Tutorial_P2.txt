Octave Computing:
*	You can multiply two matrices using >> A*B
*	You can also multiply individual elements ising >>A .* B 
*	We can also square a matrix using A .^2 % . shows that its an elementwise operation.
*	You can resiprocal using 1 ./A
*	We can do log(V) and also exp(V) and abs(V).
*	We can do -V.
*	We can add 1 to all elements by >>V + ones(length(V), 1)
*	We can also add 1 to a matrix by doing V + 1.
*	We can do transpose of a matrix using A'.
*	We can find maximum value in a matrix by doing >>max(A).
*	max(A) also returns index by >>[val,ind] =max(A). % A is a vector.
*	To find max in a matrix you have to do max(max(A)))
*	we can do sum(A) on a vector to return sum of all elements.
*	We can also do prod(A) to return product of all values.
*	Floor(A) and ceil(A) round up and down to nearest integer.
*	A(:) turns matrix to a 1 column vector.
*	To take a matrix inverse you can do pinv(A)

Conditions and Loops:
*	We can do a for loop using >> for i=1:10, v(i) = 2^i % v is a vector of 10
* 	examples : >> for i= 1:20 ; v(i) = v(i)+v(i); end;
	error: A(I): index out of bounds; value 11 out of bound 10
	>> for i= i:10 , v(i) = v(i) +v(i); end;
	>> v
	v =  8   8   8   8   8   8   8   8   8   8
*	While loop is simply  >> i=1, while i<50, i=i+1;end; % i will become 50
*	Break statement >> i=0; while i<300, i=i+1; if i==10, break; end; end;
	>> i
	i =  10
*	If and then else:
	>> if i==10; disp('the value of i is 10'),
	elseif i==20,
	disp('the value of i is 20'),
	else , disp('there is some other value'), end;
	the value of i is 10

Functions:
*	In Octave, functions are defined in files with .m extension.
*	We can search for a .m file and execute the function.
*	The function body is written in this file.
*	Example >> squareThisValue(10);
	>> value = squareThisValue(10);
	>> value
	value =  100
*	We can add the CLASSPATH of the functions using Octave Searchpath
	addpath('C:\Users\ang\Desktop')
*	We can also return multiple values in Octave from a function:
	see file squareAndCubeValues.m
*	>> [a,b] = squareAndCubeValues(2);
	>> a
	a =  4
	>> b
	b =  8
