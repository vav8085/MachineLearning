Model Representation:
*	Reference :Stanford machine learning.
*	Training set is represented with below variables.
*	m = Number of training examples.
*	x = Input variable/ Feature.
*	y = output variable Target.
*	(x, y) - One training example.
*	(x(i), y(i)) - ith training example.
*	We use this training set to train our learning algorithm.
*	The learning algorithm outputs a function that gives an output for an input.
*	The function is called a hypothesis (h).
*	For linear regression in one variable, it can be y = mx + c like equation.
*	Or it can be parabolic in case of quadratic regression.
* 	Cost Function is : j minimize(theta0, theta1) = 1/2m(summation 1->m)(h(x(i))-y(i))^2 
	where y is output and h(x) is calculated value from hypothesis.
*	The best hypothesis gives the minimum value of the cost function.
