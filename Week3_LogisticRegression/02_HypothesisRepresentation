Hypothesis for Logistic Regression:

1.  We always want value of h(x) between 0 and 1.
2.  In logistic regression we have h(x) = g(theta^T x)
    where sigmoid function/logistic function g(z) = 1/(1+e^-z)
    => h(x) = 1/(1+e^-(theta^T x))
3.  Because logistic function is always between 0 and 1 our
    hypothesis will also always remain between 0 and 1.
4.  h(x) will give a value that will act as probability of y=1.
    If h(x) comes out 0.7 a certain person has 70% probability of y=1.
5.  h(x) = P(y=1|x; theta) is the notation used to show probability of y=1
    where feature is x and Probability is parameterized by theta.
6.  We can also say that Probability of tumor is benign where tumor size
    is x.
7.  x= vertical[x0 x1] = vertical[1 tumorSize]
8.  P(y=1|x; theta) = 1 - P(y=0|x; theta)
9.
