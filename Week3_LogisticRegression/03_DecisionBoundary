Decision Boundary:

1.  We can see that the sigmoid function g(z) is greater than 0.5 when
    z>=0.
2.  So h(x) = g(theta^T x) >=0.5 when theta^T x >=0. And y will be 1 in this case.
3.  Also h(x) = g(theta^T x) < 0.5 when theta^T x <0. And y will be 0 in this case.
4.  Decision boundary is the line that separates y = 1 from y =0. It could be a circle,
    a straight line or any curve.
5.  Decision boundary is a property of a hypothesis and not a dataset.
