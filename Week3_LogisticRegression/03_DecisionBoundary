Decision Boundary:

1.  We can see that the sigmoid function g(z) is greater than 0.5 when
    z>=0.
2.  So h(x) = g(theta^T x) >=0.5 when theta^T x >=0. And y will be 1 in this case.
3.  Also h(x) = g(theta^T x) < 0.5 when theta^T x <0. And y will be 0 in this case.
4.  Decision boundary is the line that separates y = 1 from y =0. It could be a circle,
    a straight line or any curve.
5.  Decision boundary is a property of a hypothesis and not a dataset.
6.  Decision boundary can be any shape, it can be a parabola, an ellipse , circle etc.
7.  if we have multiple variables x1, x2, x3 ... then we compare the function >=0 for y=1
    and <0 for y = 0. like x1^2 +x2^2 >=1 is a circle of radius 1.
