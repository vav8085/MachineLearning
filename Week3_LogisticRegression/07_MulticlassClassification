Multi Class Classification

1.  This is a type of classification problem where we have more than 2 classes.
    these can be the cancer is malignant or benign or something in between.
2.  If you see the binary classification problem plot we plot two different classes with
    two different symbols {O,X} for cancer is malignant or benign.
3.  Don't confuse with our input variable x1,x2,x3.. those were the various dimensions
    affecting the value of y, like cell size, number of cancerous cells, other conditions.
4.  Multiple classes are actually multiple values of Y for binary its 0,1 for multi class
    it can be 0,1,2...
5.  Just like we had a decision boundary for the binary classification we have boundary
    for multi class classification as well.

One Versus all:
1.  In one versus all classification we consider one class at a time and call it ONE.
    and we group all other classes and call them REST.
    so it becomes ONE vs REST binary classification.
2.  We do this once for every class and each one gives us a different h(x).
    like h1(x), h2(x).....
3.  We then run logistic regression on all the hi(x) and find the one that
    gives the closest value to y and the highest probability of  i=y.
